# Coin
> iPhone app created to help someone track and manage their bills. Written in Objective-C and uses Heroku and Parse Serve for the backend.

## Things I Learned
This was my final project for my mobile development class at Weber State University. So far into the project I have learned a lot about the entire full stack of an iOS application from authenticating a user to storing entities in the database. I hope to continue this project one day and deploy on the Apple App Store.

## Credits
Several projects aided in inspiring this project. Notably they are:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Parse Server](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/)
